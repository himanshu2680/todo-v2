version 2 features- add an item, check it and strikethrough using checkbox, delete it using close icon(appears on hover); default list rendered as today's date; create custom lists by appending list name in the title bar and auto capitalize it.

feature wishlist- add a box on bottom left that has all the listnames and user can click on any of them to go to that list; add an option to delete on checking the checkbox and hide close button then; maybe use localStorage as database; delete last item if user types /d, check using /c; delete the specified item if user types /d 1, /d 2 etc. or more complex combinations such as "/d 1; /c 2;/d n"; add a modal that states these power features, or let the modal state that there exist some easter eggs, and mention those eggs in console. maybe even keep the eggs deactivated and enter cryptic hints in console to activate them.
